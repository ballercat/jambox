## NextJS + GraphQL Jambox Demo

## Install

Make sure to run `yarn` and `yarn build` at the root of this repo.

```
yarn
```

Set a `browser` option in `jambox.config.js` to either `chrome` or `chromium` based on
what you have installed on your system. The default is `chromium`.

## Run

```
‚ùØ yarn dev
yarn dev
üìª Jambox üìª
Process launched
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000

```

## Visit the page

```
‚ùØ yarn visit
üìª Jambox üìª
http://jambox-demo-graphql.vercel.app parsed as a URI. Launching a browser instance
chromium launched with 17172
Browser launched
```

A page should load at `http://jambox-demo-graphql.vercel.app`

![](./initial.png)

Note that this URL is simply proxied to your local NextJS app at `localhost:3000`

Search for a couple of Pokemon, like "Picachu"

![](./pikachu.png)

And "Slowpoke"

The GraphQL requests to `https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app` should work fine,
you can search for more images. Now we can turn off network requests in `jambox.config.js`

```
{
  blockNetworkRequests: true
}
```

Now try searching for additional Pokemon and notice how the requests fail. However the initial
requests should still work as they are cached in the `.jambox/` folder.

You may clear the `.jambox` folder to start fresh.

## Cleanup

To shutdown the server:

`curl localhost:9000/shutdown`
